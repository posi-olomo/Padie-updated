# 🌟 **GistAI** 🌟

**GistAI** is an evolving, open-source Python package designed to enable conversational AI systems with support for Nigerian languages, including **Pidgin**, **Yoruba**, **Hausa**, and **Igbo**. It provides AI-powered tools for **language detection**, **intent recognition**, and **response generation**. GistAI is community-driven, encouraging contributions to expand its capabilities and datasets.

> 🔧 **Note:** GistAI is currently in development. The core framework is in place, but models are being trained and refined. We are actively gathering datasets to improve performance.
