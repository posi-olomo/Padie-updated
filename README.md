**Padie** is an evolving, open-source Python package designed to enable conversational AI systems with support for Nigerian languages, including **Pidgin**, **Yoruba**, **Hausa**, and **Igbo**. It aims to provide AI-powered tools for **language detection**, **intent recognition**, and **response generation**, while fostering community collaboration to enhance its capabilities.

> **🔧 Note:** Padie is a work in progress. Models are being trained and refined, and we’re actively gathering datasets to improve accuracy. Your contributions can make a difference!

## 🛠️ **Handling Datasets and Citations**

### **Dataset Format**

Datasets should follow a structured format. Each entry must include at least the following fields:

```json
{
    "text": "Example input text.",
    "label": "language_label",
    "format": "format_type",
    "source": {
        "provider": null,
        "url": null
    },
    "citation": null
}
```

### **Citations**

-   If the data includes a citation, create a **unique citation code** (e.g., `"c1"`, `"c2"`) and add the citation details to a separate file named `citations.json`.
-   Replace the citation field in the dataset with the corresponding code.

#### **Example Citation File (citations.json):**

```json
{
    "c2": {
        "title": "Naija Language Translation",
        "author": "Wazobia",
        "year": 2021,
        "url": "https://example.com/naija-paper"
    }
}
```

#### **Example Dataset Entry with Citation Code:**

```json
{
    "text": "Example text in a Nigerian language.",
    "label": "pidgin",
    "format": "article",
    "source": {
        "provider": "BBC",
        "url": "https://www.bbc.com/article"
    },
    "citation": "c2"
}
```

### **Why Use a Citation File?**

-   Ensures clarity by centralising citation details.
-   Prevents redundancy and reduces dataset file size.
-   Facilitates easier management and updates.
