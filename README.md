**GistAI** is an evolving, open-source Python package designed to enable conversational AI systems with support for Nigerian languages, including **Pidgin**, **Yoruba**, **Hausa**, and **Igbo**. It aims to provide AI-powered tools for **language detection**, **intent recognition**, and **response generation** while fostering community collaboration to enhance its capabilities.

> **🔧 Note:** GistAI is a work in progress. Models are being trained and refined, and we’re actively gathering datasets to improve accuracy. Your contributions can make a difference!
